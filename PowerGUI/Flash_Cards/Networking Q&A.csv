"Questions","Answers"
"What does DHCP stand for?","Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol"
"Explain the purpose of DNS (Domain Name System) in computer networks.","DNS is used to translate domain names (e.g., www.example.com) into corresponding IP addresses (e.g., 192.168.1.1) to enable communication between devices."
"What is a subnet mask, and how is it used?","A subnet mask is a 32-bit value used to divide an IP address into network and host portions. It helps determine which part of the IP address identifies the network and which part identifies the individual device on the network."
"Name and briefly explain some common network topologies.","Common network topologies include:

1. Bus: All devices are connected to a single cable.
2. Star: Devices are connected to a central hub or switch.
3. Ring: Devices are connected in a closed loop.
4. Mesh: Each device has a direct connection to every other device.
5. Hybrid: A combination of two or more topologies."
"What is the default port used for HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)?","Port 80 is the default port used for HTTP."
"Explain the difference between TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol).","TCP is a connection-oriented protocol that ensures reliable data delivery by establishing a connection between sender and receiver. UDP is connectionless and does not guarantee reliable delivery, making it suitable for real-time applications like video streaming and VoIP."
"What is a MAC address, and how is it different from an IP address?","A MAC (Media Access Control) address is a unique hardware address assigned to each network interface card. It operates at the data link layer of the OSI model. Unlike IP addresses, which are logical and assigned to devices by the network administrator, MAC addresses are burned into the network interface card during manufacturing and are used for local network communication."
"Explain the purpose of NAT (Network Address Translation) in networking.","NAT allows multiple devices on a local network to share a single public IP address. It acts as an intermediary between the internal network and the internet, translating private IP addresses to the public IP address and vice versa."
"What is the function of a router in a network?","Routers are devices that connect different networks together and determine the best path for data to travel between them. They use IP addresses to forward data packets between networks."
"What is the role of a firewall in network security?","Firewalls are security devices that monitor and control incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predefined security rules. They act as a barrier between trusted internal networks and untrusted external networks, protecting against unauthorized access and potential threats."
"Explain the concept of VLANs (Virtual Local Area Networks).","VLANs are logical segmentation of a physical network into multiple virtual networks. Devices within a VLAN can communicate with each other as if they are on the same physical network, even if they are physically located in different parts of the network."
"What is the purpose of STP (Spanning Tree Protocol) in network switches?","STP is used to prevent loops in Ethernet networks by selectively blocking certain redundant paths. It ensures a single active path at any given time to avoid broadcast storms and network instability."
"Explain the concept of OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model and its seven layers.","The OSI model is a conceptual framework used to understand and standardize network communication. The seven layers are:
1. Physical: Deals with physical connections and electrical signals.
2. Data Link: Provides error-free data transmission between nodes on the same network segment.
3. Network: Handles routing and forwarding of data packets across different networks.
4. Transport: Ensures reliable data delivery and error correction.
5. Session: Manages communication sessions between applications.
6. Presentation: Translates data to a format understandable by the application.
7. Application: Provides network services directly to the user."
"What are the differences between half-duplex and full-duplex modes of data transmission?","In half-duplex, data can be transmitted in both directions, but not simultaneously. It operates like a walkie-talkie where you have to take turns speaking and listening. In full-duplex, data can be transmitted simultaneously in both directions, like a telephone conversation."
"Explain the purpose of ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) in networking.","ICMP is used to send error messages and operational information about network conditions. It helps diagnose connectivity issues, such as when a ping request fails."
"What is the purpose of ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) in networking?","ARP is used to resolve IP addresses to MAC addresses on a local network. It helps devices identify each other on the same network by associating IP addresses with their corresponding MAC addresses."
"What is a proxy server, and how does it work?","A proxy server acts as an intermediary between a client device and the internet. It receives requests from the client, forwards them to the internet, receives the responses, and then sends them back to the client. This process helps enhance security, performance, and privacy for the client."
"Explain the concept of port forwarding.","Port forwarding allows inbound traffic from the internet to be directed to a specific device or service on a private network. It enables users to access services hosted on devices behind a NAT router."
"What is the purpose of a DHCP relay agent?","A DHCP relay agent forwards DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) messages between clients and DHCP servers across different subnets. It helps clients obtain IP addresses from DHCP servers that are not on the same local network."
"Explain the role of a proxy ARP in a network.","Proxy ARP is when a device responds to ARP requests on behalf of another device. It happens when a device receives an ARP request for an IP address that is outside its local network but belongs to a device on the same network."
"What is the purpose of a default gateway in networking?","A default gateway is the IP address of the router that devices on a local network use to communicate with devices on other networks, including including the internet. It serves as the exit point for traffic going outside the local network."
"Explain the concept of port security in network switches.","Port security is a feature in network switches that restricts the number of MAC addresses allowed on a switch port. It prevents unauthorized devices from connecting to the network by limiting the number of devices that can be connected to a specific port."
"What is the purpose of NAT (Network Address Translation) in IPv6?","In IPv6, NAT is not typically used because IPv6 addresses have a large enough address space to accommodate all devices. Instead, IPv6 uses a different approach called Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC) to assign addresses automatically."
"Explain the concept of QoS (Quality of Service) in networking.","QoS is a set of techniques used to prioritize and manage network traffic, ensuring that certain types of data, such as voice or video, receive higher priority and better service over the network. It helps maintain performance and reduce latency for critical applications."
"What is the purpose of a VPN (Virtual Private Network) in networking?","A VPN creates a secure and encrypted connection between a client device and a remote server over the internet. It allows users to access resources on a private network securely, even when they are not physically present in the network's location."
"Explain the concept of network segmentation.","Network segmentation is the process of dividing a large network into smaller, isolated segments or subnets. It enhances security, performance, and manageability by limiting the scope of network traffic to specific areas."
"What is the purpose of NAT (Network Address Translation) in virtualization?","In virtualization, NAT is used to allow virtual machines to share the host machine's IP address while maintaining network isolation. It helps conserve IPv4 addresses and provides a level of security by acting as a barrier between the host machine and the virtual machines."
"Explain the concept of SDN (Software-Defined Networking).","SDN is an approach to networking that separates the control plane from the data plane. It centralizes network management through software controllers, allowing administrators to dynamically configure and manage network devices and services."
"What is the purpose of a MAC filter in wireless networking?","A MAC filter restricts access to a wireless network by allowing only specified MAC addresses to connect. It provides an additional layer of security, although it can be bypassed by MAC address spoofing."
"Explain the concept of port triggering in router settings.","Port triggering is a feature in routers that dynamically opens and closes ports based on specific outbound traffic. It allows incoming traffic to access certain services temporarily, reducing the risk of unauthorized access and improving security."
