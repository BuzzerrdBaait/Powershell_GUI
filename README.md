# Powershell_GUI
This is a GUI framework based on a drag and drop method. You drag your .ps1 files in or out of the main folder to create or remove buttons. Each button will run your .ps1 file.

# note

Right now I have to get a microsoft developer account and figure out how they want me to sign. It wont be too long but if you want you can just copy the code and make your own .ps1 file for now.  Otherwise you will have to self sign here is a link for info if you wanted https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/pki/new-selfsignedcertificate?view=windowsserver2022-ps . Just make sure the folder that conatins main.ps1 if located on your home desktop. Powershell_GUI uses the users home desktop to handle file paths dynamically. This is where it looks for your main.py file.
